"""StorageProvider port — S3-compatible object storage.

PDF uploads, methodology exports, and irradiance snapshots all live in
S3-compatible storage so the same adapter code works against R2, S3,
GCS (interop), and MinIO (local dev) — only the ``s3_endpoint_url`` and
credentials change. Per the project stack rules, no provider-proprietary
features sit in the hot path.

The Protocol is intentionally narrow: ``put`` / ``get`` / ``delete`` /
``exists`` / ``list``. The 24-72h PDF TTL purge (chart-solar-ebo)
composes ``list`` + ``delete``; nothing here knows about TTLs because
the policy lives one layer up. Encrypt-at-rest is the adapter's job —
the Protocol carries no public/ACL knobs because the only supported
configuration is **private buckets, encrypted at rest** (LEGAL § F1).
